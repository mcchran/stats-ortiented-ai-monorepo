##  Likelihood
Likelihood: we question if a model fits to some observations:
``` 
Or how likely is that this model describes that observations properly?
```
This is  a hard to answer question. So we try to answer the dual one:
```
Given a set of observations and some particular model how likely is that these observations derive from that model? 
```


## Linear regression
In the context of the linear regression example I provided, a predictor variable, also known as an independent variable, is a variable that is used to predict the value of the response variable. In other words, it is an input variable that is used to make predictions about the output variable.

In the example above, X is a matrix of predictor variables. Each column in the matrix represents a different predictor variable, and each row represents a different observation. For example, if you were trying to predict the price of a house based on the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms, then the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms would be the predictor variables.

In a linear regression model, the goal is to find the line that best fits the data, where the line is defined by its slope and intercept. The slope represents the relationship between the predictor variable and the response variable, and the intercept represents the value of the response variable when the predictor variable is equal to zero.

In general, the predictor variables are assumed to be fixed and known, while the response variables are random variables that are observed.
